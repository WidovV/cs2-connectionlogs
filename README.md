## Description
This plugin adds players to a database to track when they join with their ip.  
It prints to discord through a webhook when a player join (with their ip) and leaves.  
It has a command !connectedplayers that prints the 50 recent players that joined the server (only available if a databse is used)

## Config
The config will automaticly be generated on first run and will be placed inside `/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/ConnectionLogs`.
Colors can be used in every key-value that is a string like so {White} or {Red} (this is case insensitive, thanks to [k4ryuu](https://github.com/K4ryuu) for the idea), every color in the ChatColors class can be used.
Example:
```json
{
  "ChatPrefix": "[CPH-{Darkred}GAMING{white}]",

  "SendMessageToDiscord": true,
  "DiscordWebhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/",

  "StoreInDatabase": true,
  "DatabaseHost": "192.168.1.210",
